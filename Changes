Revision history for Term-Chrome

{{$NEXT}}
	- Improved doc for ${} and &{} overloading
	- Test::Synopsis is now an *optional* test dependency

1.012  2015-11-03 01:00:13 CET
	- Document a workaround for codulation of constants on perl < 5.21.4
	  (use a do {} around the constant)

1.011  2015-10-21 09:13:44 CEST
	- Fix t/12-codulation.t for perl >= 5.21.4

1.010  2015-10-21 01:51:21 CEST
	- Add &{} overloading ("codulate") to easily wrap some text with color
	  and Reset. Unfortunately, it is not usable in practice due a core
	  perl bug < 5.21.4.
	  This allows to build efficient "chromizers" (closures that colorize
	  and Reset).
	- Disable fallbacks for overload.pm, to reduce (dangerous) magic
	- Remove ->clone method that is useless as Term::Chrome values are
	  immutables

1.001  2014-08-24 00:43:54 EEST

1.000  2014-08-23 12:35:33 EEST
